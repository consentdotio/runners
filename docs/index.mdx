## Installation

```bash
npm install runners
# or
pnpm add runners
# or
yarn add runners
```

**If you're using Playwright runners**, install Playwright browsers:

```bash
npx playwright install
# or
pnpm exec playwright install
```

## Core Concepts

### Runner

A **Runner** is a single test or check function that:
- Receives a `RunnerContext` and optional input
- Returns a `RunnerResult` with status and details
- Can use Playwright for browser automation (opt-in)

### Runner Harness

A **Runner Harness** is the execution environment that:
- Loads runners from your codebase
- Executes runners with proper context
- Handles errors and timeouts
- Returns normalized JSON results

### Orchestrator

An **Orchestrator** coordinates execution across:
- Multiple regions
- Multiple URLs
- Multiple runners
- Aggregates results from distributed runs

## Examples

Check out the [examples](../examples/) directory for complete working examples:

- **[Basic CLI](../examples/basic-cli/)** - Simple CLI usage
- **[Hono](../examples/hono/)** - Hono/Nitro integration
- **[HTTP API](../examples/http-api/)** - Standalone HTTP server
- **[Orchestrator](../examples/hono-orchestrator/)** - Multi-region orchestration
