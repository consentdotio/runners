## What is Runners?

Runners is an open-source SDK that transforms TypeScript functions into executable, distributable test functions. Built for modern development teams, it provides a unified solution for:

- Writing simple test functions
- Running tests locally or in CI
- Distributing tests across multiple regions
- Executing tests via HTTP API
- Orchestrating multi-region test runs

Gone are the days of:

- Complex test infrastructure setup
- Worrying about browser management
- Manual container orchestration
- Region-specific deployment complexity
- Inconsistent test execution environments

## Core Principles

### 1. Developer-First

Runners is built with developer experience in mind:

- Write simple async functions with `"use runner"` directive
- TypeScript-first with full type safety
- Zod schemas for runtime validation
- Zero configuration for local execution
- Framework integrations for seamless deployment

### 2. Run Anywhere

The same runner function can run in multiple environments:

- **Locally**: Via CLI for development and debugging
- **CI/CD**: Integrated into your build pipeline
- **HTTP API**: Exposed as an API endpoint
- **Distributed**: Orchestrated across multiple regions globally

### 3. Performance & Reliability

Built with production in mind:

- Schema pre-extraction for fast startup
- Parallel execution with concurrency control
- Automatic error handling and timeout protection
- Normalized results across all execution modes
- Browser reuse for Playwright-based runners

### 4. Open Source

Building in public for transparency and collaboration:

- Inspect and understand the execution engine
- Contribute improvements and fixes
- Self-host for complete control
- Trust through transparency
